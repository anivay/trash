# trash
TERA Proxy module to discard undesired items from your inventory

# Usage
Edit config.js to set auto-discard default and list items you want trashed.

## Commands
* **trash**: discards all trash in inventory, aka manual garbage-collect instead of automatic 
* **trash auto**: toggle auto-discard 
* **trash list**: prints out all items in trash list
* **trash help**: prints out list of commands and their description

# To-Do
Need to do a lot of testing in-game to make sure everything works.

Manual trash command seems iffy. 

Doesn't discard existing trash in your inventory until you pick up some trash.
